Statistical programing code for data analysis described in JA Villars et al. Proton Pump Inhibitor Use Exceeding the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approved Treatment Duration for Patients With Peptic Ulcer Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. DOI 10.1002/pds.70152

## Overview
These analyses use data from the Veterans Health Administration in the United States to identify explanatory factors for proton-pump inhibitor prescriptions that persist beyond the recommended treatment duration for peptic ulcer disease.

## Dataset
The original data contain patient identifiers. To facilitate distribution of the statistical programming code, we have developed a random synthetic dataset not based on any real patient data. These data are provided in "Inappropriate PPI.zip" in the "Extraction" subfolder.

## Software
This analysis utilizes Stata.

## Instructions

1. Download "Inappropriate PPI.zip" to your device.
2. Unzip "Inappropriate PPI.zip".
3. In the unzipped folder, navigate to the Scripts subfolder.
4. Open "Inappropriate PPI.do" using Stata.

   4A. Enter the path to the "Inappropriate PPI" folder between the quotation marks on line 13.

   4B. Run the entire script.

   4C. Results will be saved in the "Tables" and "Figures" folders.

   4D. Note that because the data are synthethic, results will not correspond to those from the publication.
